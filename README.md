A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it.

Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police departmentâ€™s database.

### Searching for murder on __Jan.15, 2018__

~~~sql
SELECT * 
    FROM crime_scene_report 
    WHERE date=20180115 AND type='murder' AND city='SQL City';

### Seeking the witnesses

#### The first witness, the one who lives in the last house of "Northwestern Dr".
~~~sql
SELECT * FROM person 
WHERE address_street_name='Northwestern Dr' 
Order by address_number desc
LIMIT 1
~~~
Result:

#### The second witness, the one who is named Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave".
~~~sql
SELECT * FROM person 
WHERE 
	address_street_name='Franklin Ave' 
AND 
	name like 'Annabel%'

|16371|Annabel Miller|490173|103|Franklin Ave|318771143|

### What the witnesses told
~~~sql
SELECT p.name,p.id,i.transcript 
FROM interview as i
JOIN person as p on p.id=i.person_id
WHERE i.person_id in (14887,16371)
